# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

The goal of this project is to use TF-IDF and the Nave Bayes Classifier to develop a movie review classification system. The dataset for this project is from Kaggle, and the dataset is known as the IMDB dataset. The models were then created using a naive Bayes classifier and a random forest method. The alpha and grid search was used to tune hyperparameters. When a movie review is run through the algorithm, it predicts the mood of the review with an accuracy of 88 percent.
